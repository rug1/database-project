## Database Project!

This week you will be creating a chat room that updates in real time (obviously). You will need to implement both socket.io and a database.

 * Use socket.io for real time messages
 * Use a database to store the messages
 * Deploy your chatroom to heroku

##### Stretch Goals
 * Make usernames
 * The ability to create rooms/private messaging
 * See a list of users who are available online
 * Add “{user} is typing” functionality

##### Don't Forget
 * NO FOR LOOPS ALLOWED
 * Badges - [code climate & coverage](https://codeclimate.com), [code crystal](https://codecrystal.herokuapp.com/), [build](https://travis-ci.org/). Any other badges you add will be a bonus.
 * Testing frontend and backend - at least 80% coverage on backend
 * Continuous Integration - Set up travis
 * A readme that includes instructions on how to run your project
